# In code events, code event is an action that happens in lua, by default this is 10 times the amount of the normal luac, set 0 to disable (fine if you have enabled the execution time limit, but still might pose a risk) 
async_controller.maxevents (Async controller execution code-event limit, set 0 to disable) int 100000

# in microseconds, 1 milisecond is 1 000 microseconds, set 0 to disable, but keep in mind that doing that allows luacontrollers to easily crash your server
async_controller.execution_time_limit (Async controller execution time limit) int 10000
